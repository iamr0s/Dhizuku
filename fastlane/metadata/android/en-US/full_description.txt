<i>Dhizuku</i> is a tool that allows you to share device owner permissions with other apps.

This app is similar to Shizuku (ADB) and Magisk (Root) but instead, it shares device owner permissions with other apps. An example use would be having a new Installer in the Aurora Store for allowing devices such as those sold in Japan (and those where normal package installation is blocked) to install apps from third-party app stores.

Make sure to follow the <a href="https://github.com/iamr0s/Dhizuku/discussions/19">Activation tutorial</a>

<b>Enable service:</b>
You can use the following methods to enable the service:
<ul>
    <li>Shizuku</li>
    <li>ADB</li>
</ul>

Several apps already use Dhizuku. If you want to integrate it with yours, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/iamr0s/Dhizuku-API">Dhizuku API repository</a>
